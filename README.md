# WineQuality: Data Analysis with Python
For this data analysis project I explored a wine quality dataset.
  - Used matplotlib, seaborn to perform data exploration and data visalization.
  - Binned target variable to create a classification problem instead of a regression problem
  - Used RandomForest, XGBoost and cross-validation to create a model.
  - Explored the feature importance of the models using their GINI scores
